# General information about the Jupyter Notebooks

Various existing notebooks are available through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gw-inux/Jupyter-Notebooks/).

You can download the Jupyter Notebooks and work with them **locally** on your own. The required steps for setting up your device for local working with Jupyter Notebooks are described for example in the iNUX Handbook. Typically, you have to install Python and Jupyter Notebook. A convenient distribution of the most required software is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Alternatively, you can access and process the Jupyter Notebooks **online** by, for example, the MyBinder service. The required links are provided in the _Courses and Projects_ part of this page. This also presents a suitable way of combining a selection of Jupyter Notebooks from the repository for a specific use case (e.g., as accompanying material for a course). _More information and discussion of ways to execute Jupyter Notebooks are available, for example in an [overview from Dmitry Soshnikov](https://soshnikov.com/education/how-to-execute-notebooks-from-github/). 

_**Please be aware** that accessing and executing the Jupyter Notebooks through the **MyBinder Service can take some time to start** the server. Usually, the first start takes longer because MyBinder needs to set up a server with a specific installation for you. Subsequent starts (in the following minutes) should be faster. Sometimes, when accessing the Jupyter Notebook as Voila-Dashboard, it can be useful to reload the page in case the process seems to be stuck.

Further contributions are very welcome (e.g., using the [Incoming](https://github.com/gw-inux/Jupyter-Notebooks/tree/main/99%20INCOMING) section in the repository).
